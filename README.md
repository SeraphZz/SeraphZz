Hi, I’m Seraphz (but you can call me guto as well), i'm 17 years old, I'm a Brazilian I.T highschool student residing in Rio de Janeiro, aiming to do Comp. Sci. in the UFRJ College.
I’m interested in Coding and Programming, as well as computer maintenance.
I’m currently learning Python and C#, i know VB.net and some HTML but my HTML skills are not very good.
I’m looking to learn code in an interesting manner, as in using for future skills and projects
You can HMU using Discord. (saintseraphz)
Looking forward to learn and improve myself everyday.
