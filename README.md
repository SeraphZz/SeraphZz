Hi, I’m Seraphz (but you can call me guto as well), currently in version 17.0, I'm a I.T highschool student aiming to do Comp. Sci. in College.
I’m interested in Coding and Programming, as well as computer maintenance.
I’m currently learning Python and C#, i know VB.net and some HTML but my HTML skills are not very good.
I’m looking to learn code in an interesting manner, as in using for future skills and projects
You can HMU using Discord. (saintseraphz)
